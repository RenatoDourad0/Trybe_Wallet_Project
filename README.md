## Overview

### The project

In this project I developed a single page application using React. It is called TrybeTunes and it's users are capable of play songs from the most varied bands and artists, create a list of favorite songs and edit the profile. Some of it's main features are:

- Login
- Search for a band or artist
- List available albums by that band or artist
- View songs from a selected album
- Play a preview of the songs on this album
- Favorite and unfavorite songs
- View the list of favorite songs
- See the profile of the person logged in
- Edit the profile of the person logged in

The main habilities practiced here were:

- Make requests and consume data from an API
- Use the lifecycle methods of a React component
- Use the setState function to ensure that a given code is only executed after the state is updated
- Use the BrowserRouter component correctly
- Create routes, mapping the URL path with the corresponding component, via Route
- Using the React Router Switch
- Create navigation links in the application with the Link component
