## Overview

### The project

In this project I developed a wallet aplication using React. It's users are capable of register expenses in different currencies and catalog them by tag or 
payment method. The aplication requests exchange rates data from a currencies API and convert the user expenses to brazilian Real. Users are also able to visualise their expenses on graphs. Some of it's main features are:

- Login form with validations
- Add expense form
- Expense edition
- Expenses table and graph interface

The main habilities practiced here were:

- Make requests and consume data from an API
- Apply redux global state to react components
- Apply redux thunk for async actions 
- Save data to localStorage
- generate graphics with graph.js
